This project aims to make the [ios-settings-url](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/ios-settings-urls) repo more easy to browse, since its great width. The [ios-settings-url](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/ios-settings-urls) repo was created and is curated by [FifiTheBulldog](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog). This website was designed and developed by [alombi](https://alombi.xyz).

FifiTheBulldog's project is a big collection of URL schemes for the iOS Settings app. These URLs can be used in Shortcuts, Scriptable or for lots of others scopes.
